Improve the ability of C++


##First 
use the information as I know, to build a system:
*1. the scholl can use the system to finsih the basic operation.
*2. can easily add new funcation.
*3. when the system has some error, it should work fine, giving the information about the error instead of just crash.
*4. use the new syntax
*5. try to use multithreading
*6. try to use class to make all work fine

##Second
make it easy to understand and code review by myself. (<- do some check list)
